= Introduction =
Amana is a tool for AirMech. AirMech generates repetition files each time you play a game (online or offline). To watch your replay is slow and painful process. So to avoid all this commotion, I created Amana tool so you can review AirMech replays easier.

= First time using Amana =
It should be noted that your replays are autogenerated *only if you created the replays folder before* in the AirMech directory... but do not worry! because the first time you use Amana it will create it for you. I clarify it for you to know why you should not have any `.replay` files yet.

= Requirements =
  * Java 1.6.0 or newer versions installed. (If not installed, when you try to open Amana, v1.5 send you to the java download page).
  * Windows XP or Win7 (32/64-bit).
  * AirMech installed (PC or Steam version).

= Opening Amana =
Just open the Amana executable file.
For *Version 1.4.1 and below*: Open rmlabs-amana-1.x jar file, this requires java installed.

= Using Amana =
