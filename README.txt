Hi! This is the second release of the Amana Project.

To open Amana just double click in the jar file. It requires java duh!

Yeah it's too simple (close to lame), but its for free and it's going to been improved every week. (kind of)

Everytime you open Amana, it creates your replay folders if they don't exist.

If you delete the content of the config.properties file and restart Amana, it generates the config content automatically if is not there.
Also, if you modify it, your changes are keeped =)
